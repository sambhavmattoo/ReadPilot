Azure Functions host.json - Field-by-field Explanation

Fields:
- version: Specifies the runtime version for Azure Functions. '2.0' is required for all modern Python, Node.js, and .NET function apps. This field is mandatory and controls the runtime behavior and compatibility.

This file configures global host-level options for all functions in the app. For most use cases, only the version field is needed unless you are customizing logging, extension bundles, or other advanced host settings.
